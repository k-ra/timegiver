# Timegiver

## About
Welcome to Timegiver! Here you can spontaneously find local volunteer opportunities based on your busy schedule. 

## Get started
To run the app, please clone the repo on your desired IDE. Please install any packages when the IDE prompts you to do so. Run the Flask app locally.
For example, you can install the cs50 package via
```
$ pip3 install cs50
```

#### If you are an organization wishing to post opportunities
Register and log in as an organization, post your openings and write in any details you'd like. You can then check your openings and those who signed up for them in the "Check Post" tab. You can then reach out to the volunteer via the email provided.

#### If you are a student finding opportunities
Register and log in as a volunteer. Put the amount of hours you would like to spend, and the type of activity you are interested in. We will filter through all of our openings and show the ones that match your preferences. You can then register with a simple click. Now all you do is wait!

Both organizations and volunteers can update their time and openings seamlessly via our platform.

## Why we made this
Time is a most valuable resource. A problem a lot of us face is finding the right opportunity for community service given the spontaneity in our busy schedules. We want to create a platform that provides a user with service opportunities that fit their time and skills. When left with spare time, our website will allow the user to find a meaningful opportunity to fill their time, whether itâ€™d be three hours or just thirty minutes. The user would also be able to filter through time, interest, and preferences. We hope that this can be adopted to be a helpful, customized, and secure tool for any nonprofit organization's internal management of volunteers.

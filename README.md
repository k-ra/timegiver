## About
Welcome to Timegiver! Here you can spontaneously find local volunteer opportunities based on your busy schedule.

For example, you can install the cs50 package via

#### If you are an organization wishing to post opportunities
Register and log in as an organization, post your openings and write in any details you'd like. You can then check your openings and those who signed up for them in the "Check Post" tab. You can then reach out to the volunteer via the email provided.

#### If you are a student finding opportunities
Register and log in as a volunteer. Put the amount of hours you would like to spend, and the type of activity you are interested in. We will filter through all of our openings and show the ones that match your preferences. You can then register with a simple click. Now all you do is wait!

Both organizations and volunteers can update their time and openings seamlessly via our platform.
